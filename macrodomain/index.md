# Identifying new ligands for the SARS-CoV-2 Macrodomain by Fragment Screening and Multi-temperature Crystallography

## TLDR:

Macrodomain is a compelling target for SARS-CoV-2, but there are no inhibitors (or even starting points for inhibitors). The QCRG Structural Biology Consortium performed a crystallographic fragments screen, identifying a few small molecules to kick-start our work to develop an inhibitor. Our friends in the UK, Ivan Ahel's lab and X-Chem, [did something similar](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/NSP3-macrodomain-structure-and-XChem.html) and found even more fragment starting points. We are releasing [the data together](https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/react/preview/target/mArh)!
