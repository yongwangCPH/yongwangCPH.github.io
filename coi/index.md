 I try to be as transparent as possible about my conflicts of interests. If these  conflicts cause an issue with the work or working relationship between me and a lab member, I want people to have those conversations with me early. My department chair would be a good person to talk to if you donâ€™t feel comfortable talking to me about it directly.
