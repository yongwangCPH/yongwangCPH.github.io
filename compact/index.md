# Lab Compact and Philosophy
<br/>

## Mentorship
The most important thing I can do is give people the resources to accomplish what they want to accomplish in the lab, and make sure what they're doing is setting them up to grow for the position they want next. The kinetics of this is more determined by their personal desires for what they want to do in their career and not on my desires to keep them in the lab longer (see Conflicts of Interest). I recognize the itinerant nature of their career. I'm trying to push people on to what's next. Always. I try to work as hard as I can to give my lab the resources, including my time and my guidance, towards their goals.  
>
Specifically I aim to:
* Keep the lab well funded to provide access to modern equipment, supplies, methods, and facilities.  
* Maintain a safe work environment both physically and mentally.  
* Provide access to training, resources, networking, collaboration, and presentation opportunities to facilitate lab members research and career goals.  
* Be engaged with the latest science and current status of all lab projects to enable proper guidance.  
* Give my lab members ample amounts of my time both around the lab and one-on-one.

## 合作
##### Internal-
In addition to myself, all of your lab members are a resource. It is expected that you will develop collegial relationships within the lab and occasionally work on shared projects. The spirit between lab members should be of cooperation and not adversarial competition. To that end, we try not to reinvent the wheel and make efficient use of everyone’s time by sharing our knowledge. Protocols are updated and shared in Benchling for everyone in the lab to use and several guides exist on the internal lab site for nearly every task, administrative or scientific, that anyone may need. We are all here to help each other, but also be mindful and respectful of your fellow lab members' time. If someone in the lab has helped you a lot on a project they probably should be included as an author on your publications.
##### External-
The diverse nature of work in the lab encourages a lot of collaboration with partner labs both within UCSF, at other universities, and in industry. Lab members are expected to foster relationships with our collaborators inline with our values of transparency and cooperativity. In other environments collaborations have been tricky for some people. However, our collaborations have been very positive, and I try to do my part to ensure that continues to be the case. Lab members can expect me to be actively involved in both the details of the project as well as communication with the partner labs. I will have my lab members’ backs and manage difficult conversations such as authorship. I also feel an important factor to fruitful partnership is to all actually be in the same place from time to time and so I encourage travel for scientific collaborations. I’m happy to provide funding to facilitate these visits and meetings.

## 写作 
For all science career paths, being able to explain yourself and the value of your work is an invaluable skill. Funding our research is vital to keeping the lab running and grant/proposal writing is the responsibility of the entire lab. My lab members and I collaborate together to write grants and proposals to fund themselves, to fund lab research and equipment, and to request use of scientific facilities outside of UCSF.  There are resources on the internal website to assist with this.

## 学术会议
Talk about your work openly. Share early. A key component to information transparency is getting it out there. People should present their work at conferences as they are great ways to communicate our results and get other people excited about our work. Conferences are important to build your network as well as your science communication skills. I think everyone should attend 1-2 conferences a year. I encourage people to charge lab-related travel expenses to the lab. Your time is valuable; consider this when booking flights and ground transportation.
