## My Bio

I obtained BSc degrees in Computer Science (minor) and Chemistry (major) from Jilin University in China (2001-2005), and an MSc degree in Analytical Chemistry from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of Jin Wang (汪劲) and Erkang Wang (汪尔康 院士) (2009-2012). Between 2005 and 2009, I worked as a Research Fellow in CIAC, CAS, and subsequently was promoted to Research Associate (助理研究员). My work during this period focused on answering basic biophysical problems e.g. in the areas of protein folding, intrinsically disordered proteins, and large-scale conformational changes using multiscale modeling. In 2013 I move to Denmark to pursuit my PhD in Biology under the supervision of [Kresten Lindorff-Larsen](https://twitter.com/LindorffLarsen) and obtained my PhD degree in Dec. of 2016. Since then I has been recruited in a five-year [BRAINSTUC](https://brainstruc.ku.dk/) project in close collaboration with experimental groups by integrating e.g. HDX-MS, NMR, SAXS, and CryoEM, with simulations/modeling and enhanced sampling techniques. 

I am currently an assitant professor (助理教授) in the department of biology at University of Copenhagen. I will start my own group as a tenure-track associate professor (浙大百人A研究员) at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China since June of 2021. Contact me if you are interested in working or collaborating with me.
