# Welcome to the Wang Lab!
{: .display-4}
<br>
We are part of the [College of Life Sciences ](http://www.cls.en.zju.edu.cn/), the [Insitute of Quantitative Biology](http://www.cls.en.zju.edu.cn/), and the [ Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study](http://www.cls.en.zju.edu.cn/).

Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics.  We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.

We are located in 688 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou at the ZijingGang Campus of ZJU.
