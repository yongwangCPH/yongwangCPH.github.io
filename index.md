# About Yong Wang
He holds BSc degrees in Computer Science (minor) and Chemistry (major) from Jilin University 
and an MSc degree in Analytical Chemistry from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
His work during this period focused on answering basic biophysical problems e.g. in the areas of protein folding, intrinsically disordered proteins, 
and large-scale conformational changes in folded proteins using coarse-grained models and enhanced sampling methods. 
In 2013 he move to Denmark to pursuit his PhD in Biology/Biochemistry under the supervision of Kresten Lindorff-Larsen 
and obtained the degree at the end of 2016. Since then he has been recruited in a long-term (five-year, BRAINSTUC) project 
in close collaboration with other five experimental groups in Denmark by integrating e.g. HDX-MS, NMR, SAXS, and CryoEM, with simulations/modeling.

Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics.  We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.
