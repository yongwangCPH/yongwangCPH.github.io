# MD Analysis tools:
* [getcontacts](https://github.com/getcontacts/getcontacts)
  * Application for efficiently computing non-covalent contact networks in molecular structures and MD simulations
* [flareplots](https://gpcrviz.github.io/flareplot/) 
  * Flareplot is an open source library for visualizing and interactively exploring dynamically changing networks.

# Visulization tools:
* [MolStar](https://molstar.org/) 
  * The Mol* toolkit provides a comprehensive solution for molecular data delivery, visualization and analysis that can be embedded into a wide range of 3rd party solutions. It includes a customizable plugin for high quality WebGL based molecular data visualization, as well as servers for model and experimental (X-ray, Cryo-EM, etc.) data delivery, efficient BinaryCIF data format support, and other exciting features.
* [Protein Imager](https://3dproteinimaging.com/protein-imager/)
  * Gianluca Tomasello is the founder of the online protein visualization tool Protein Imager.
* [qutemol](http://qutemol.sourceforge.net/)
  * QuteMol is an open source (GPL), interactive, high quality molecular visualization system. QuteMol exploits the current GPU capabilites through OpenGL shaders to offers an array of innovative visual effects. QuteMol visualization techniques are aimed at improving clarity and an easier understanding of the 3D shape and structure of large molecules or complex proteins. **no support anymore.
