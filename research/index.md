# Our research
The long-term goals of our research are to understand how protein conformational ensembles are reshaped by chemical, genetic, and physical perturbations. We seek to quantify how these perturbations impact protein function and organismal fitness. We are best known for creating multitemperature X-ray data collection approaches, which are especially powerful when paired with multiconformer computational modeling to reveal otherwise inaccessible features of conformational ensembles. Our group integrates high resolution structural biology (X-ray, EM, NMR), functional studies (deep mutational scanning, enzymology), and computation to study biological mechanisms and to improve protein engineering and small molecule discovery. Group members move fluidly between computation and experiment, often inventing new methods to answer their questions.

#### We work on many different systems and proteins as we find ourselves drawn, again and again, to the tension of high resolution data in structural biology: as resolution gets better, modeling becomes easier... until the resolution gets too good... and then the ensemble begins to reveal itself and the fun challenges begin.

### Identifying hidden alternative conformations of proteins and ligands in biophysical data

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

We study proteins as conformational ensembles.
Although X-ray crystallography is an ensemble experiment, the results are typically summarized with a single static structure.
We develop [**software**](https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0) to discover the structural ensembles present in the crystal (or on the EM grid).
The ensemble nature of proteins highlighted by this work feeds into all of our mechanistic studies that interpret the functional effects of mutations, that characterize designed and artificially-evolved proteins, or that seek to modulate protein function with small molecules.
These methods development efforts are central to discovering new allosteric ligands, through high throughput crystallographic fragment screening efforts.
We are expanding, this direction to include modeling and validating protein structural data generated by cryo-electron microscopy (using EMRinger and ensemble modeling) and through integrative approaches to discover cryptic ligand binding sites.

### Identifying unifying concepts between systems and structural biology

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">


We are intrigued by the similarities in genetic epistasis and thermodynamic measurements and are applying these insights to large-scale studies of point mutants and posttranslational modifications. We attempt to connect the response to genetic (mutation), chemical (ligands), and physical (temperature) in experiments to define the basis of allosteric regulation and function. We like to bring an evolutionary biology perspective to the table to understand the relative importance of these different perturbations in shaping the proteins we see today.
