# Our research

#### We work on many different systems and proteins as we find ourselves drawn, again and again, to the tension of high resolution data in structural biology: as resolution gets better, modeling becomes easier... until the resolution gets too good... and then the ensemble begins to reveal itself and the fun challenges begin.

### Identifying hidden alternative conformations of proteins and ligands in biophysical data

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

We study proteins as conformational ensembles.
Although X-ray crystallography is an ensemble experiment, the results are typically summarized with a single static structure.
We develop [**software**](https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0) to discover the structural ensembles present in the crystal (or on the EM grid).
The ensemble nature of proteins highlighted by this work feeds into all of our mechanistic studies that interpret the functional effects of mutations, that characterize designed and artificially-evolved proteins, or that seek to modulate protein function with small molecules.
These methods development efforts are central to discovering new allosteric ligands, through high throughput crystallographic fragment screening efforts.
We are expanding, this direction to include modeling and validating protein structural data generated by cryo-electron microscopy (using EMRinger and ensemble modeling) and through integrative approaches to discover cryptic ligand binding sites.
