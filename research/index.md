# Our research

#### My work lies at the interface of chemistry, biophysics, and computer science. Here are some research themes of current interest.

### Multi-scale modeling
<br>
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

Using a combination of theory and computer simulation, we work to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying functionality of materials systems. We develop techniques that bridge nanoscale electronic structure to mesoscale charge and energy transport, as well as macroscopic thermodynamic and mechanical properties. Current systems of interest include low-dimensional semiconductors, liquid- and solid-state electrolytes, and their interfaces.

### Enhanced sampling methods
<br>
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2 ">
We study proteins as conformational ensembles. Although X-ray crystallography is an ensemble experiment, the results are typically summarized with a single static structure. We develop software to discover the structural ensembles present in the crystal (or on the EM grid). The ensemble nature of proteins highlighted by this work feeds into all of our mechanistic studies that interpret the functional effects of mutations, that characterize designed and artificially-evolved proteins, or that seek to modulate protein function with small molecules. These methods development efforts are central to discovering new allosteric ligands, through high throughput crystallographic fragment screening efforts. We are expanding, this direction to include modeling and validating protein structural data generated by cryo-electron microscopy (using EMRinger and ensemble modeling) and through integrative approaches to discover cryptic ligand binding sites. These methods development efforts are central to discovering new allosteric ligands, through high throughput crystallographic fragment screening efforts.

### Integrative structural biology
<br>
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

We are intrigued by the similarities in genetic epistasis and thermodynamic measurements and are applying these insights to large-scale studies of point mutants and posttranslational modifications. We attempt to connect the response to genetic (mutation), chemical (ligands), and physical (temperature) in experiments to define the basis of allosteric regulation and function. We like to bring an evolutionary biology perspective to the table to understand the relative importance of these different perturbations in shaping the proteins we see today.
